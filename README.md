# Vanilla JS Todo List App

This build was originally constructed during a live one hour tutorial while tutoring for Unlock Academy, but I've since cleaned up the code.

## Description
This basic implementation fetches a "todo" list using the built-in JS `fetch` function from a third-party API and allows the user to interact with the checkboxes.

## TODO
[ ] allow an item to be added
[ ] allow an item to be deleted

## Features / Skills Used
- API Integration: Uses the `fetch` API to GET and PUT data
- Bootstrap CSS
- Event Listeners
- HTML/JS Templating
